# Snake Game Usage

## Generate account on testnet

Generate a test account on the testnet at the address below using Google Chrome:

https://testnet.cspr.live

You will be required to download and enable the Casper Signer Chrome extension.

Fund your test account by going to:

https://testnet.cspr.live/tools/faucet

## Run the game

Visit the game website here:

https://snake.playcasper.io/

Play the game.

When the game is over you will be asked to save your score on the Casper Block Chain.

The Casper Signer extension will popup. Ensure you are logged in and the extension is connected to the website.

It can take up to a minute for the score to be saved and a notification will be given.

## Verification

You can verify that the deploy to save the score was complete by visiting the testnet site. You will be able to see the deploy on this page:

https://testnet.cspr.live/deploys

When you first start the game, the highest overall score is pulled from the block chain and appears at the top of the page.

If you have played the game before and saved your score then on subsequent attempts you will be shown your highest score pulled from the blockchain.
